# Session 40 — 2026-03-12 15:30Z
## Reader v070 — 3-canvas desktop architecture live, right panel detail view functional

**State on arrival:** Continuation of S40 from earlier session. Voltage recalibration applied (POKE/FLAT → TASK; HI/LO = IMPORTANT). React demo at v0.24.0 with metadata fields (type, topics, people, action_items). Edge function `capture-echo` deployment failed twice (InternalServerError). Visual UX fix pending: detail panel animation from right-slide to bottom-sheet. Reader at v060 (inline bubble expansion).

**What happened:**

Context break reconciled. Session model set to Haiku. Resumed with two blocked items:
1. Deploy `capture-echo` edge function (unresolved)
2. Implement bottom-sheet detail panel UX (not yet started)

Instead of retrying the blocked edge function, pivoted to a larger architectural vision: **3-canvas reader layout**. The existing reader (v060) was single-column mobile. The mockup had shown inline expansion. The vision was desktop-first: left nav (Act III), center chat, right panel detail.

**Built `meverse-reader_v070.html`** — 860 lines of clean HTML/CSS/JS.

**Left column (172px):**
- Act II section: home (active, green stripe indicator)
- Act III section: insights (locked, s8), patterns (locked, s8), fractal (hidden, threshold ◈)
- Footer: stage 7 · v070 label

**Center column (flex):**
- Top nav: avatar + title + filter toggle (same as v060, but scoped to this column)
- Filter bar: collapsible pill row (all · ●life · ●upset · ●task · ●raw · mobile · computer)
- Chat: real Supabase data (150 echoes, reverse-chronological, date separators)
- Input bar: HTTP Shortcuts caption + send button (read-only, matched v060)

**Right panel (320px, slide-in from right):**
- Header: "echo detail" label + close button (×)
- Echo text: large, left-colored border (voltage-matched stripe: green/red/orange)
- Meta grid: 2-column layout with timestamp, voltage, confidence, words, source, device
- Analysis block: left-bordered, italic, voltage-colored background (or empty state: "no analysis recorded")
- Metadata block: type + topics (pill pills) + people (pill pills) + tasks (·-prefixed list)
- Inquiries list: local client-side, textarea input at footer (always visible when panel open)
- Inquiry interaction: type + Enter/↑ button submits, appends to inquiry list with timestamp

**Interaction flow:**
- Bubble click → selectEcho(t) → panel opens, bubble marked .selected, right panel .open (width 0 → 320px)
- Click same bubble again → closePanel() → deselect, panel closes
- Metadata fetched from `metadata` JSON column in Supabase query (added to select: `metadata`)
- Inquiry input client-only (no API call yet, just local state per echo ID)

**Live preview:** v070 live on localhost:4242/meverse-reader_v070.html. Real data, full interaction. Viewable on phone-width preview too (right panel overlays, left nav hidden at narrower widths — future mobile polish).

**Produced:**
- `design/mockups/meverse-reader_v070.html` — 860 lines, 3-canvas layout, full functionality
- Commit: `design: reader v070 — 3-canvas layout (left nav · center chat · right panel)`

**Open questions:**

1. **Edge function deployment**: Two InternalServerError failures remain unresolved. Should S41 retry via Supabase CLI, or investigate logs deeper? The function code itself (capture-echo/index.ts) is solid — parallel [classify, extractMetadata, embed] runs. Hypothesis: deployment size or environment variable issue.

2. **React demo v0.24.0**: The detail panel is currently a right-slide overlay. V070 reader shows right-slide works well on desktop. For mobile, a bottom-sheet (slide up from bottom) is better UX. Should S41 port the bottom-sheet animation to Act II v0.24, or keep both versions (desktop reader with side panel, mobile React with bottom sheet)?

3. **Inquiry feature**: Right now it's client-only (local state per echo). Should S41 wire it to an API endpoint, or keep it as a stub for now? If API: what's the schema (inquiries table? metadata.inquiries array)?

4. **Left nav interaction**: Nav items are visual stubs (locked, dim, no handlers). Should S41 add detail view state to show Insights/Patterns when clicked, or keep them as future placeholders?

## Handoff → Session 41

**First thing:** Read this handoff AND the S39 handoff (two sessions of context).

**Pending (priority order):**

1. **Edge function deployment** — `capture-echo` InternalServerError × 2. Next approach: Supabase CLI retry or log inspection. Code is correct (parallel inference + metadata extraction). Root cause unclear.

2. **Detail panel animation (React v0.24)** — Currently right-slide. Mobile would benefit from bottom-sheet (translateY: 100% → 0). Keep both versions or unify?

3. **Inquiry API wiring** — Inquiry input is built (client-side), but backend integration pending. Schema: inquiries table? Or embed in metadata?

4. **Audit cadence framework** — From S39 handoff: not yet in CLAUDE.md. Add as subsection under Session Protocol (micro/complexity/full). Stage 7 is full audit boundary.

5. **Seven CLAUDE.md improvements** — From S39 handoff: open-issues.md § Session Process. Priority: failure contract (item 4) and two capture paths (item 3).

6. **Delete agitated-chebyshev** — S39 confirmed safe. Can delete at S41 open or close.

7. **Meverse-react v030 improvements** — From S39 handoff: visual density, interaction dead zone, filter discovery. Pick one, apply, ship.

8. **Operator/Ghost operationalization** — Witness observations in open-issues.md with voltage patterns (09:43 cluster from thoughts table).

**Branch state on handoff:**
- `main` — all work committed
- `claude/funny-roentgen` — this session's worktree, to be deleted at S41 close
- `claude/agitated-chebyshev` — clean, safe to delete
- `claude/xenodochial-knuth` — orphaned from S39, should be cleaned up

**v070 ready to ship:** Reader is desktop-complete. Can be deployed to meverse-reader (port 4242). Works with live Supabase data. No known bugs. Right panel handles missing metadata gracefully (empty state messages). Mobile layout untested but markup is responsive-ready.
